# What is the `rad-project` skill?

The work-graph is a live map of the projects in the system — what exists, what state each is in, how they relate, and where their worktrees are. By default your view is the project you're working in, but projects don't stand alone: they're organized into initiatives, they follow one another in a series, or they branch off as offshoots — and each may have worktrees across one or more repos. Use it to answer three things: what projects exist and what's in progress; how a project relates to others (its group, what it follows, what spawned from it); and where a project's worktrees are, so you act in the right place.

# How you should work

- **Orient before acting.** Check what's in progress and where this project sits before diving in.
- **Work in the right place.** Find the project's worktree and act there — see [references/where-to-work.md](references/where-to-work.md).
- **Surface relationships.** Bring "part of X / follows Y / spawned-from Z" into your answers and decisions.
- **Organize when it's messy.** Offer to group related work and capture how projects relate.
- **Keep the structure honest.** Use real group names and descriptions, accurate links — no junk.
- **Report crisply.** Answer "what's going on" without dumping raw data.
- **Know the boundary.** Surface and organize; don't create projects, run the pipeline, or manage worktree lifecycle.

# No-args behavior

`/rad-project` with no prompt returns a summary of the active projects — the `in_progress` set — not a bare help screen. Resolve it via `project list --status in_progress` and present the results in plain language.

# Lane note

This skill handles project identity, relationships, and worktree location. Questions about repository identity and the repo registry belong to `/rad-repo`. Questions about commits and pull requests belong to `/rad-source-control`. Worktree lifecycle (create and clean up) lives in the **act lane** — see `/rad-source-control`.

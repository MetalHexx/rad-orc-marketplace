description: Use this skill to start the rad orchestration dashboard UI.  It is the reference for how to launch the UI and obtain the URL.  Use it when the conversation indicates the user wants to start the dashboard.  This is commonly used during brainstorming, planning or executing a project or sharing a visual diagram or markdown document with the user.  It provides a visual overview of the project and its current state, and allows the user to interact with the pipeline in a more intuitive way.

# rad-ui-start

Invoke the bundled CLI to launch the radorch dashboard UI:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs" ui start
```

The CLI emits a single JSON envelope on stdout. On success, compare `data.requested_port` (the configured port the CLI tried first) against `data.port` (the port actually bound): if they differ, tell the user the dashboard came up on a different port than configured, then report `data.url` — the URL to open in a browser. On failure the envelope's `error.message` describes the cause (typical case: every port in the configured scan range is taken, anchored at the deployed `ui.port` or its default) — relay it verbatim.

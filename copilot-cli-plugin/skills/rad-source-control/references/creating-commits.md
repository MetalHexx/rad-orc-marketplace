## Commit Mode

**1. Build the commit message** from the spawn prompt. Derive the prefix from the task title or type (first match):

| Keywords | Prefix |
|----------|--------|
| feature, feat, new | `feat` |
| fix, bug, patch | `fix` |
| refactor, restructure, clean | `refactor` |
| test, testing, spec | `test` |
| doc, docs, documentation | `docs` |
| *(no match)* | `chore` |

For a multi-repo task, compose **one** commit message header in a single pass:

Format: `{prefix}({taskId}): {title}`
Optional body: blank line then 2–4 prose lines from the task description.

**2. Pre-commit HEAD check (per repo).** The spawn context supplies each repo as `{name, path, branch}`. Before committing, confirm the live worktree HEAD is attached to that intended `branch`:

    git -C "<path>" symbolic-ref --short -q HEAD

- Output equals the intended `branch` → include the repo in the commit.
- Command fails (HEAD detached) or prints a different branch → do **not** commit that repo; emit the off-branch escalation (below) for it instead.

**3. Run (fan-out across all repos in one command):**
```
node "${COPILOT_CLI_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs" git commit \
  --repos '[{"name":"<repo>","path":"<worktree-abs-path>","message":"<commit-message>"}, ...]'
```

Where `--repos` is the JSON array of per-repo objects (each carrying `name`, `path`, and `message`). The CLI commits every repo in a single pass and returns a structured per-repo result array.

**4. Parse the envelope on stdout. The `data.repos` field is a per-repo array. Relay the entire array into one array-shaped `commit_completed` signal:**
````
## Commit Result
```json
{
  "repos": <data.repos>
}
```
````

Each entry in `data.repos` carries: `{ "name": "<repo>", "committed": <bool>, "commitHash": "<hash-or-null>", "pushed": <bool> }`.

A partial-success commit (commit landed but push failed) is still envelope-success (`ok: true`); the failure surfaces via `pushed=false` on the affected repo entry. Treat committed repos as commit successes regardless of push outcome.

A remote-less repo (such as a side-project) also returns `ok: true` with `pushed=false`. This is expected — the commit succeeded and there is simply no remote to push to. Do not treat it as a failure.

A `committed: false` entry means the repo was skipped (e.g., no changes). This is a clean skip — relay it as-is in the array; the mutation ignores it without error.

**Post-commit advancement check (per committed repo).** For each repo that returned `committed: true`, confirm HEAD is still attached to its branch and the branch advanced to the new commit:

    git -C "<path>" symbolic-ref --short -q HEAD   # still equals the intended branch
    git -C "<path>" rev-parse --short HEAD          # equals the commitHash just returned

If HEAD is detached after the commit, or the branch ref did not advance to the new commit, replace that repo's normal commit row with the off-branch escalation (below). A remote-less `pushed:false` or a no-change `committed:false` skip is **not** an off-branch condition — leave those relayed as-is.

**Off-branch escalation (per repo).** When the pre- or post-commit HEAD check fails for a repo, do not relay a normal commit row for it — relay a distinct, loud escalation so the orchestrator halts:

    ## Off-Branch Escalation — <repo>
    { "repo": "<repo>", "off_branch": true, "expected_branch": "<branch>",
      "observed_head": "detached at <sha>" | "on <other-branch>",
      "commit_created_off_branch": <bool> }

This is not a `commit_completed` success row and carries no recordable hash. Halt the fan-out and surface every off-branch repo by name.

PR Mode is never invoked for a side-project (`auto_pr: never`). A side-project has no remote and therefore no pull-request surface; skip the PR step entirely when the project kind is `side-project`.

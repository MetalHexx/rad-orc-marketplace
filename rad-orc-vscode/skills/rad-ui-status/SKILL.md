# rad-ui-status

Invoke the bundled CLI to check the radorch dashboard UI:

```
node "${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs" ui status
```

The CLI returns `running: true` with `url` when the recorded PID is alive, otherwise `running: false`. Stale PID files are cleaned automatically. Relay the status (and URL when running) to the user.

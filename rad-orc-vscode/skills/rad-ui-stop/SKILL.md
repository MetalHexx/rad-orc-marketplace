# rad-ui-stop

Invoke the bundled CLI to stop the running radorch dashboard UI:

```
node "${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs" ui stop
```

The CLI sends SIGTERM to the recorded PID, removes the PID file, and emits a success envelope. If the UI was not running, the envelope still reports `stopped: true` (idempotent). Report the result to the user.
